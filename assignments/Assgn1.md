## Deploying Virtual Machines

**Question 1** *Suppose you are running a Windows machine, but you have a program that needs to run in a Linux environment. How can you run the program while still technically using your Windows machine?*

In order to maintain the Windows environment, a person must run Windows as the host operating system, and then run Linux in a hypervisor (virtual machine) environment. This will allow the Linux application to run without terminating the Windows environment.

**Question 2** *What is the difference between a native and a hosted virtual machine monitor (hypervisor)?*

**Question 3** *What is the difference between a virtual machine and a virtual appliance?*

**Question 4** *What are the associated benefits of using virtualization software? Give a few examples of each benefit..*

**Question 5** *What is the difference between native and hosted virtual machine monitors?*

**Question 6** *What are the three components of virtual machines?*

## Hardware Virtualization

**Question 1** *Verify that the computer you are using for the class is able to handle hardware virtualization. Along with the apps/commands needed to determine whether or not hardware virtualization is enabled, include a screenshot that shows the computer is hardware virtualization enabled. Use something like Snip&Sketch or the equivalent Apple screen shot app.*

**Question 2** *Read the article at the link:*

[Cloud Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/virtualization)

*and write a few sentences about the downside of running virtual computers on your laptop or desktop. Do not use ChatGPT or other AI application. After writing your answer to this question, run a request into ChatGPT to see what the bot finds. Compare your answer to the response from ChatGPT.*

**Question 3** *Provide a screen shot of the resources available on your physical computer. How many cores, speed, and so on. You can find the information in the About tab in the Updates and Security section on the computer. Use a screen shot of the popup window.*

**Question 4** *What are the benefits of virtualization, and what is one situation where you would want to use a VM instead of a physical machine?*

**Question 5** *What is the difference between a native system virtual machine and a hosted system virtual machine?*

**Question 6** *What are 2 operational benefits of virtualization?*
